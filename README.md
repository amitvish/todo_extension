to-do chrome extension
Steps to follow:
Creating a to-do list Chrome extension from start to finish, including publishing it, is a multi-step process. Here's a concise step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Ensure you have Google Chrome installed on your computer.
Install Visual Studio Code (since you mentioned you use it) or any code editor of your choice.
Step 2: Plan Your Extension

Decide on the features and functionality of your to-do list extension.
Sketch the user interface and outline the core functionalities.
Step 3: Create the Extension Folder

Create a new folder for your extension project, e.g., "todo_extension."
Step 4: Create the Manifest File

Inside the "todo_extension" folder, create a manifest.json file 
Step 5: Create the Popup HTML

Create a file named popup.html in the "todo_extension" folder. This will be the popup interface for your to-do list.
Step 6: Create the Popup JavaScript

Create a file named popup.js in the "todo_extension" folder. This file will handle the functionality of your to-do list.
Step 7: Create the Popup CSS

Create a file named popup.css in the "todo_extension" folder to style your popup interface.
Step 8: Implement the To-Do List Functionality

In popup.html, design your to-do list interface with HTML and use CSS to style it.
In popup.js, write JavaScript code to manage adding, editing, and deleting tasks, and storing tasks in the Chrome storage API.
Step 9: Test Your Extension

Open Google Chrome, go to "chrome://extensions/", and enable Developer mode.
Click on "Load unpacked" and select your "todo_extension" folder.
Your extension icon should appear in the Chrome toolbar. Test its functionality.
Step 10: Package Your Extension

In the Chrome Extensions page, click "Pack extension."
Provide the path to your extension directory and create a .crx file.
Step 11: Publish Your Extension

Go to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard).
Sign in with your Google account.
Click "Add a new item."
Fill out the required information, including a detailed description, screenshots, and promotional images.
Upload the .crx file created in the previous step.
Pay the one-time developer registration fee (if required).
Publish your extension.
It may take some time for your extension to be reviewed and approved by Google before it becomes publicly available in the Chrome Web Store.

Remember to update your extension as needed and engage with user feedback to improve it over time.
